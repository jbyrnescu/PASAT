This zip file contains the executable as well as the recording template.  Before you run the test, launch Excel
with the recording template loaded.  Then as the test is exercised add the subject/testee's correct or
incorrect answers to the Excel spreadsheet by marking the incorrect row with a lowercase 'x'.  The Excel spreadsheet 
scores the answers automatically if you enter it correctly.  Don't worry about recording the testee's answers, just 
if it was correct or incorrect.
